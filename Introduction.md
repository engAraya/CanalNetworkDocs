# Introduction to CanalNETWORK software

Well come!

CanalNETWORK is a software product that offers targeted solution to the design, analysis and documentation of a system of gravity canal networks. It is a product of a committed work to understand the practice of irrigation systems design in the local context, as well as governing theory in open channel hydraulics. 

This introcution is intended to give basic knowledge about the key problems that the software solves, and different tools available to solve them. It focuses on key features of the software, and is NOT a comprhensive document containing all the details. 

The following topics are discussed:

- Uses and application of the software

- Data and software required to run the software product

- Basic workflow for tackling the design of irrigation systems design using the software.

Refer to other sections of this documentation to learn more about specific usage and application of the software to tackle day to day design tasks.

# Uses and applicaiton of CanalNETWORK software

CanalNETWORK software is an all-in-one solution, that allows to design, analyse and document the planning and design of canal irrigation systems. It allows to process data from start to end, allowing production of reach graphic and tabular documents to AutoCAD, as well as other text presentation software.

CanalNETWORK software for use in:

* A system of open canal irrigtion network (supply only)

* Canal network connectivity analysis, and automatic generation of labels /tags for entire network

* Complete and detailed Longitudinal design of individual canal routes

* Automated generation of detailed and summary bill of quanity

* Automated generation of different drawing products

* Collaboration between enginners and team leads to tackle large scale projects

* Compact saving and sharing of design data

* ,,, and more.
  
  



## Data and Software required for use with CanalNETWORK

Working with CanalNETWORK software requires the following tools:

* iCAD software (a related product)

* AutoCAD 2018 and latter

* Matlab Runtime R2021
  
  



In addition, text and spreadsheet applications are also helpful to export and/or import data to and from.



CanalNETWORK software handles detailed design task for an system of irrigation canals, whose layout has been well prepared. It does NOT include solution for creating layout of canals. The following data are required to start using the software:

* A canal layout drawing on AutoCAD: This provides the basis for the design of network of canals as a system.

* Topo cloud data (from surveying or other source): that is used to generate profile data for longitudinal design

* a design criteria for the project: that provides detailed values of reference criteria and other governing factors (e.g., duty, slope, limiting velocity...)



 

## Standard workflow

CanalNETOWORK allows for flexible design approaches and processes. However, due to high dependency of tasks on available data, it is recommended to adopt the below discussed workflow. Adopting this workflow is proven to offer optimal progress towards the final products in the shortest possible time.
