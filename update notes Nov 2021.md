The updates in the november release include the following features

## Optimal bed slope design function
An interactive tool allows users to critically analyze the current or desired canal flow section and easily apply it to the desired segment of a given canal route. The tool incorporates a built in optimization algorithm to find canal parameters that satisfy differnt objective functions. 

In the current release two objective funcions are included.
Obj Min Bed Slope
Obj Max Bed Slope

Subject to 
Vmin <= v <= VMax
Tau <= Taumax

## Curve handling
During import of routes, automatic identification and reading of curve data is introduced. 

The same functionality is included to the [AlignmentProfile] tool in iCAD, allowing users to work with curves easily.
Note: geometric design of curves is now fully entertained in AutoCAD environment, Once imported, the user has no option or tools to change any of the curve parameters.

## Variable drop height
