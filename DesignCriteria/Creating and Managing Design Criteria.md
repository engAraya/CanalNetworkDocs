# Creating and Managing Design Criteria



Establishing a set of design criteria is the basis of design work. These data are also the key input data for tackling the sizing and detailing of a network of canal system in CanalNETWORK. See Standard workflow in Introduction to see at which stage of project design this may be required. However, it is highly recommended to set a design criteria set as the first step in creating a project workspace. 

> Note: Design criteria can be edited at any stage of the design process. However, your changes may not have any impact until you have re-applied it by invoking other processes. Most variables are applied to the actual route data base during the network sizing stage, and reapplying newly modified design criteria requires invoking this task, risking the loss of all design works you have completed earlier. It is therefore, a strongly recommended practice to set the data set at the beginning and to try and maintain it thorough the project design process. 

CanalNETWORK environment in the software offers tools to set and edit key criteria for design work, corresponding to each generation of canals. 

There are two options for creating design criteria set for a given project. These are:

* Default Criteria set, found in software library.

* Pre-created criteria file stored in *.dcf* file



### Default criteria set

This method very common among users. It brings forward the default criteria set build in depending on the naming style of choice. Once the default criteria is loaded, one can always edit the contents to suit project conditions. To use the default criteria set:
